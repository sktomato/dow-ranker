# dow-ranker

Ranks the stocks of one week by their **predicted return next week relative to the average stock**, with
an honest prediction interval and checks on the input. It packages the ridge model from my 4EK481/4EK666
semestral project (Dow Jones Index, UCI) so it can be run again on new weeks, by someone else.

**For whom:** a student or analyst who wants a weekly relative-return signal *and* an honest measure of how
weak it is. The project found almost no predictable signal: on the held-out weeks the model's error equals
that of predicting 0. The tool shows this openly: the intervals (±2.2 pp at 80 %) are about 20 times wider
than the spread of the predictions. It is not a trading tool.

## Install

Python 3.10 or newer.

```
pip install "dow-ranker[app] @ git+https://github.com/sktomato/dow-ranker@v0.1.0"
```

or from a clone: `pip install -e ".[app,dev]"`. Then download the data (UCI, CC BY 4.0):

```
dow-ranker fetch-data            # -> data/dow_jones_index.data
```

## Use

**Command line**

```
dow-ranker predict data/dow_jones_index.data --week 2011-05-13          # rank one week (default: latest)
dow-ranker predict my_weeks.csv --level 0.9 --out ranking.csv
dow-ranker backtest data/dow_jones_index.data --start 2011-04-01        # coverage, MAE, IC per week
dow-ranker train new_data.csv --out models/ridge_2026.json             # retrain on newer data
```

**Python**

```python
import dow_ranker as dr

r = dr.predict_week("data/dow_jones_index.data", week="2011-05-13", level=0.8)
r.table        # rank, stock, pred_rel_return, lower, upper, out_of_range, the 6 features
r.warnings     # anything the user should know (excluded stocks, extrapolation, stale model, ...)
```

**App**

```
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Pick the data (UCI, upload a CSV, or a synthetic example), the week and the interval level. Tabs: the ranking
with intervals, the track record on weeks after the training period, and a description of the model.

The input is one row per stock and week with `stock, date, open, high, low, close, volume`, and must contain the
week before the one you rank (see [data/README.md](data/README.md)). `examples/quickstart.ipynb` walks through it.

## What the model is

Six features known at the Friday close of week *t*, from weeks *t* and *t−1* only: this week's return relative to
the average stock, the average (market) return, last week's return, the high-low range, log volume ratio to last
week, and log dollar volume. They are standardized, then fed to a ridge regression (alpha = 1421, tuned by
walk-forward CV on MAE) trained on Q1 2011 (360 stock-weeks). The model does not use tickers, so changes in which
stocks are in the Dow do not break it: the "market" is the average of whatever stocks you give it.

Intervals are split conformal: the 80 % interval is ± the 80 % quantile of the 210 out-of-fold absolute
residuals from the training folds. Every stock gets the same width.

## How it is tested

`pytest` (47 tests). GitHub Actions runs them on Linux and Windows, Python 3.10 and 3.13, after every push.

| Requirement | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Same answers as the Part II model | `scripts/notebook_reference.py` runs the notebook's own cells and saves its predictions; the package must match them for all 750 stock-weeks, and retraining must reproduce the shipped model | max difference 3·10⁻⁷ pp (the notebook used UCI's return rounded to 5 decimals); same alpha and coefficients |
| Uses only what is known | scrambling the future columns, changing or deleting all later weeks, or changing weeks before *t−1* leaves the prediction unchanged | unchanged |
| Bad inputs | missing column, empty file, duplicates, week not in the data, < 5 stocks → refused; missing/unparseable/negative values, high < low, no previous week → that stock excluded with a reason; unknown tickers, values outside the training range, non-Friday weeks, data long after training → warning | all as specified |
| Reproducible | same input → same output; row order irrelevant; model stored as JSON (no pickle) with library versions; fresh install in a clean venv | identical |
| Honest uncertainty | coverage on the 13 held-out Q2 weeks (390 rows, never used in training or tuning) must be within 5 pp of nominal | 50 %: 46.4 %, 80 %: 76.4 %, 90 %: 86.2 % |

The held-out MAE is 1.484 against 1.481 for predicting 0, and the mean weekly Spearman IC is 0.04. A test
checks that the tool never looks better than this.

## Monitoring and retraining

`dow-ranker backtest` on weeks whose outcomes are known gives what to watch:

- **Input drift:** the share of stocks flagged `out_of_range`. Dollar volume in particular grows with prices and
  inflation, so data from 2026 is far outside the 2011 training range.
- **Interval coverage over the last ~8 weeks:** retrain if 80 % intervals cover less than about 70 %.
- **Weekly IC and MAE vs predicting 0:** with a signal this weak, a negative IC for a few weeks is noise; the
  intervals matter more than the ranks.

To retrain: `dow-ranker train` on recent weeks (at least 7) re-runs the same tuning and saves a new JSON with
its own training ranges and interval widths, which you pass to `--model`.
